# I brought my real home with me 
I wanted to mainly play around with a parallax effect, but then I decided to do a scroll animation. I designed the assets in Illustrator and then implemented the Javascript Scroll Animation using libraries including GSAP TweenLite which will be used to take care of animating different properties of the image, and ScrollMagic. Bezier plugin will be used to create a path for the image to follow along.

TimelineLite is used to sequence together multiple animation and ScrollMagic will help us animate based on scroll. I built on top of my initial idea of a "Parallax through time" storyline and ended up writing a bit of text.
